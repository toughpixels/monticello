## Our Story
The Monticello Community Garden is a shared garden experience on North Monticello Avenue between
Palmer and Belden. It's a place for neighbors to gather for work, fascinating conversation, and  to learn more about gardening. The space is a [garden plot](http://neighbor-space.org/monticello-community-garden/) in Chicago's [NeighborSpace](http://neighbor-space.org/) program, providing herbs, produce and flowers to the
neighborhood.

The garden started as an informal project. It was an abandoned building, once it was torn down a guerrilla garden sprang up there. Around 2000 the lot took shape with neighbors on the 2200 block of North Monticello. A few trees were planted, and people organized some plots. Around 2002, the Green Corps Chicago helped build three raised tiers. Eventually these beds collapsed and the neighborhood came together to build one very large raised bed, filled with organic soil. 

NeighborSpace visited the garden joining the NeighborSpace program began in 2008. Established as a NeighborSpace garden, the gardeners received support for building six more raised beds, completed in 2011.

There are movies in the garden, an annual block party, and a beautiful mosaic sign crafted with nehborhood children.
